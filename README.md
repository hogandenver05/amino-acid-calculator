## Overview
The **Amino Acid Calculator** is a simple web-based application that allows users to input a sequence of nucleobases (A, T, C, G) and calculates the corresponding amino acid based on codon mapping. This tool is designed to assist students or researchers in quickly identifying amino acids from DNA/RNA codon sequences.

## Features
- Users can input nucleobases using buttons (A, T, C, G).
- Calculates the amino acid based on a three-base codon.
- Displays the amino acid name on the screen.
- Includes buttons to clear the input and submit the current codon for analysis.

## Technologies
- **HTML5** - For structuring the content.
- **CSS3** - For styling the application.
- **JavaScript** - For the logic and functionality of the amino acid calculation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hogandenver05/amino-acid-calculator.git
